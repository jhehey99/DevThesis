Input Signal
 > ex. 5 seconds, ave range 280 - 320 + data points

(Pre-Processing)
{
Interpolate Input Signal
 > each 5 seconds, 500 data points

Filter Signal
 > 10th order 5 Hz Low Pass Zero-Phase Butterworth Filter
}

(Systolic Peak Finding)
{
2-Pass Peak Finding

1st Pass
> Using find_peaks function find peaks
> get difference between each peak
> get average difference
> distance = 75% of average (parang margin)

2nd Pass
> Using find_peaks function
> and distance acquired in the 1st pass
> find systolic peaks

Note:
> The distance is to avoid false detection of diastolic peaks as systolic peaks
}

(Diastolic Peak Finding)
{
> get first derivative
> get max of filtered and max of first derivative
> gain = max filtered / max first derivative
> first derivate *= gain
> get gradients peaks by inverting y of signal, find peaks


> get minima points by inverting y of signal, find peaks
> use same systolic 2-pass peak finding 75% distance

> get diastolic peaks
> minima peak -> gradient peak = diastolic peaks
}

(Systolic-Diastolic Peak Matching)
{
> reference point = first minima point
> get all systolic and diastolic points after reference point
> get systolic points after first diastolic point from left
> get diastolic points before last systolic point from right
}
